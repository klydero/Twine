You are sitting in your [[room]] looking around and bored as usual. You feel a buzz around you and look down at your phone seeing it&#39;s a message from your [[friend on Facebook]] just wondering how you were doing. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="room" tags="" position="386,235">There isn&#39;t much inside of here. You have your bed, your collection of [[Rock CDs]], magazines from your favorite magazine company Alternative Press, and posters of some of your favorite bands hanging on the wall along with a bunch of messy laundry on the floor.



</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Rock CDs" tags="" position="325,403">You sit there looking through your collection reminiscing about the joy you had getting each and every one of these discs you have in the mail after buying them online. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="friend on Facebook" tags="" position="512,384">Your friend is named Kellie. You have known each other for about 2 years now and met on a band group that you were both a part of. She is from the UK and talks to you on a daily basis. You both have become best friends over the course of the time you have spent talking to each other online.</tw-passagedata>
